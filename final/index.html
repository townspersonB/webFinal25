    <h2 style="font-size: medium;" class="container">
        This website is all about myself aka Bawtoo Izckendar. He is currently in a class called WEB and this is the final assignment. 5 is second digit. This was made with VS code with a combination of html, css, and js, as most websites are. To be honest, the real reason I am writing this is to meet the word requirement. So I have to meet 250 words and in the prompt it says I need to talk about my family, friends, interests, and the school I go to. So I am actually the 4th Bawtoo Izckendar, but not really because my middle name is Lee, my Mom's maiden name but my dad, grandfather, and greatgrandfather were all named Bawtoo Walter Izckendar. However, middle names aren't that important so I guess it doesn't really matter. I'm just going to include random facts about me because I don't want to reveal too much, but here is some basic info. I was born in Washington state, and after a few years moved to San Francisco. I lived there for a couple years and the moved back to washington. I currently attend Eastside Preparatory School, and I am about to finish middle school. School gets out in 13 days from now, and then I will be a highschooler. By the way, I would like to recommend wordcounter.net because it is great for well, counting words. I've used it for a lot of assignments. I'm currently sitting at a table with some of my friends, Tome and Cinar. After this I have lunch and then advisory. This will be one of the final advisories, so we did a potluck. I was supposed to bring brownies but when I ran to the store this morning I couldn't find any so I got cookies instead. My friend Kumail make Dubai Chocolate Cake.
