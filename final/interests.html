    <h2 class="container">So this page also needs to be 250 words and is about my interests. So as an 8th grader I could do rowing this year which I spent a lot of time on. I got to know a lot of high schoolers because there was only on other 8th grader. I also have been doing guitar for many years. This year I also spent a ton of time on vex robotics. I also do lots of skiing, and will be teaching next year. Word. Word. Word. I actually have an interest in writing words, and no, those words right there are not meaningless as portray my character. I am currently sitting on at my dining table on a nice thursday afternoon, enjoying a glass of sparkling water. Yes, I'm just that fancy. I'm sure it obvious in any cause if some stranger actually looked at this they would know that this person is entirely fake. Actually, I was too lazy to think of more so it is based on a real person. You know they also did a joke version of me, so maybe you could find their assignment. Word word word word word word word. I really am being that trouble maker who thinks it is funny to refuse to conform and just make everything harder for everybody else. To be fair, Ms. Hollingshead can just mark me down. Ok we should be approaching the 250 word requirement. This is the issue with lots of assigments, the teachers don't utilize incentives well. Especially ones with specific rubrics. It is either you go really specific or you just say something like "ask me about it in class" and then leave everything up to your judgement. This asignment is kinda in the middle.
